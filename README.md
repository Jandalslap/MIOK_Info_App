Step 2: Configure Git in Android Studio (If Not Set Up Already)
1.	Set Git Executable: Go to File → Settings (or Preferences on Mac). Navigate to Version Control → Git. Ensure the Path to Git executable is correctly set (e.g., /usr/bin/git on Mac/Linux or C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe on Windows).
2.	Test Connection: In the same window, click Test to verify that Git is working correctly.
