This App was designed by the Kaitiaki Group of students from WINTEC City Campus for the COMP709 Mobile Application Development Module.

Our Client was AWAI of Massey University and we were tasked with providing two mobile app solutions. 

The first for the saftey of children in the home at risk of domestic violence. The second, an information app for parents and caregivers for the removal or placement of at risk youth in their care.

The Second Solution: MIOK Information App

The MIOK Information App is the second mobile solution developed by the Kaitiaki Group as part of the collaborative project with AWAI of Massey University. This app is specifically designed to support parents and caregivers involved in the removal or placement of at-risk youth, providing them with essential information and resources during critical and often emotional circumstances.

Purpose and Features
The MIOK Information App serves as a reliable and accessible tool for parents and caregivers by offering the following key features:

Comprehensive Guidance: Clear and concise information on the procedures involved in the removal or placement process, helping to demystify what can often feel overwhelming.
Access to Resources: Links to relevant support services, legal information, and counseling options tailored to the needs of at-risk youth and their caregivers.
Cultural Sensitivity: A design that acknowledges and respects the cultural values of families and communities, ensuring the app feels inclusive and approachable.

Supporting Families, Empowering Caregivers
The MIOK Information App aims to be more than just a digital resourceâ€”it seeks to provide reassurance and clarity to families during one of the most challenging periods they may face. By putting critical information and resources at their fingertips, the app supports caregivers in making decisions with confidence and care.

A Holistic Approach
Together with the MIOK Quick Response App, this solution reflects a holistic approach to addressing the safety and welfare of children and youth. While the first app focuses on immediate safety in the home, the MIOK Information App ensures that caregivers are equipped with the knowledge and support needed to navigate the complexities of care placement effectively.

The Kaitiaki Group is proud to contribute to such meaningful work, demonstrating how technology can be harnessed to create safer and more informed communities.
